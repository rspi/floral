# Floral

Floral is a zero-dependency web-component based design-system using the latest web standards.

The project is a learning experience about the latest web standards and everything involved in building a design system. From picking colors to designing, building and documenting components.

## Initial project Goals:

* No third party dependencies except potential polyfills and a test-framework.
* No build system. It should be possible to run without transpiling, minifying, bundling etc.
* Provide metadata for generation of wrappers around the components.
* Provide design tokens.
* Build a simple development server.
* Storybook-like UI for documentation.

## Interesting web standards used:

* [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)
* [Import with](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import/with)
* [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API)
